try programiz pro learn python practically get certified learn python practically get certified traversal mean visiting node graph breadth first traversal breadth first search recursive algorithm searching vertex graph tree data structure standard bfs implementation put vertex graph one two category purpose algorithm mark vertex visited avoiding cycle algorithm work follows graph might two different disconnected part make sure cover every vertex also run bfs algorithm every node let see breadth first search algorithm work example use undirected graph 5 vertex start vertex 0 bfs algorithm start putting visited list putting adjacent vertex stack next visit element front queue ie 1 go adjacent node since 0 already visited visit 2 instead vertex 2 unvisited adjacent vertex 4 add back queue visit 3 front queue 4 remains queue since adjacent node 3 ie 0 already visited visit since queue empty completed breadth first traversal graph code breadth first search algorithm example shown code simplified focus algorithm rather detail time complexity bfs algorithm represented form ov e v number node e number edge space complexity algorithm ov sorry d algorithm depth first search dfs d algorithm adjacency list d algorithm strongly connected component d algorithm fordfulkerson algorithm Â© parewa lab pvt ltd right reserved
