try programiz pro learn python practically get certified learn python practically get certified learn spanning tree need understand two graph undirected graph connected graph undirected graph graph edge point direction ie edge bidirectional connected graph graph always path vertex vertex spanning tree subgraph undirected connected graph includes vertex graph minimum possible number edge vertex missed spanning tree edge may may weight assigned total number spanning tree n vertex created complete graph equal nn2 n 4 maximum number possible spanning tree equal 442 16 thus 16 spanning tree formed complete graph 4 vertex let understand spanning tree example let original graph possible spanning tree created graph minimum spanning tree spanning tree sum weight edge minimum possible let understand definition help example initial graph possible spanning tree graph minimum spanning tree spanning tree minimum spanning tree graph found using following algorithm sorry d algorithm prims algorithm d algorithm data structure type d algorithm kruskals algorithm d algorithm greedy algorithm Â© parewa lab pvt ltd right reserved
