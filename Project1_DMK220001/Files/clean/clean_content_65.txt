try programiz pro learn python practically get certified learn python practically get certified complete binary tree binary tree level completely filled except possibly lowest one filled left complete binary tree like full binary tree two major difference complete binary tree interesting property use find child parent node index element array element index 2i1 become left child element 2i2 index become right child also parent element index given lower bound i12 let test let u also confirm rule hold finding parent node understanding mapping array index tree position critical understanding heap data structure work used implement heap sort sorry d algorithm full binary tree d algorithm perfect binary tree d algorithm balanced binary tree d algorithm binary tree Â© parewa lab pvt ltd right reserved
