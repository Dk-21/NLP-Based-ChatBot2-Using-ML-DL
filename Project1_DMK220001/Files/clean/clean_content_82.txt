try programiz pro learn python practically get certified learn python practically get certified adjacency list represents graph array linked list index array represents vertex element linked list represents vertex form edge vertex example graph represent graph form linked list computer shown 0 1 2 3 vertex form linked list adjacent vertex instance vertex 1 two adjacent vertex 0 2 therefore 1 linked 0 2 figure simplest adjacency list need node data structure store vertex graph data structure organize node stay close basic definition graph collection vertex edge v e simplicity use unlabeled graph opposed labeled one ie vertex identified index 0123 let dig data structure play dont let struct node adjlists overwhelm saying want store pointer struct node dont know many vertex graph create array linked list compile time structure using inbuilt list stl data structure c make structure bit cleaner also able abstract detail implementation use java collection store array linked list type linkedlist determined data want store labeled graph could store dictionary instead integer reason python get much love simple dictionary vertex edge sufficient representation graph make vertex complex want sorry d algorithm depth first search dfs d algorithm graph data stucture d algorithm breadth first search d algorithm adjacency matrix Â© parewa lab pvt ltd right reserved
