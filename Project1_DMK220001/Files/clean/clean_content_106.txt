try programiz pro learn python practically get certified learn python practically get certified longest common subsequence lcs defined longest subsequence common given sequence provided element subsequence required occupy consecutive position within original sequence s1 s2 two given sequence z common subsequence s1 s2 z subsequence s1 s2 furthermore z must strictly increasing sequence index s1 s2 strictly increasing sequence index element chosen original sequence must ascending order z b subsequence s1 order element ie strictly increasing sequence let u understand lcs example common subsequence b c c c c c c c among subsequence c c longest common subsequence going find longest common subsequence using dynamic programming proceeding already know dynamic programming please go dynamic programming let u take two sequence following step followed finding longest common subsequence thus longest common subsequence ca dynamic programming algorithm efficient recursive algorithm solving lcs problem method dynamic programming reduces number function call store result function call used future call without need redundant call dynamic algorithm result obtained comparison element x element stored table used future computation time taken dynamic approach time taken fill table ie omn whereas recursion algorithm complexity 2maxm n sorry d algorithm dynamic programming d algorithm rabinkarp algorithm d algorithm counting sort algorithm d algorithm floydwarshall algorithm Â© parewa lab pvt ltd right reserved
