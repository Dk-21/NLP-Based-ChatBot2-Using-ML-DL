try programiz pro learn python practically get certified learn python practically get certified selection sort sorting algorithm selects smallest element unsorted list iteration place element beginning unsorted list number comparison n 1 n 2 n 3 1 nn 1 2 nearly equal n2 complexity on2 also analyze complexity simply observing number loop 2 loop complexity nn n2 time complexity time complexity selection sort case every step find minimum element put right place minimum element known end array reached space complexity space complexity o1 extra variable temp used selection sort used sorry d algorithm insertion sort algorithm d algorithm bubble sort d algorithm shell sort algorithm d algorithm quicksort algorithm Â© parewa lab pvt ltd right reserved
