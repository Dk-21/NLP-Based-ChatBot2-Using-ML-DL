try programiz pro learn python practically get certified learn python practically get certified traversing tree mean visiting every node tree might instance want add value tree find largest one operation need visit node tree linear data structure like array stack queue linked list one way read data hierarchical data structure like tree traversed different way let think read element tree image shown starting top left right starting bottom left right although process somewhat easy doesnt respect hierarchy tree depth node instead use traversal method take account basic structure tree ie struct node pointed left right might left right child think subtrees instead subnodes according structure every tree combination remember goal visit node need visit node subtree visit root node visit node right subtree well depending order three type traversal let visualize inorder traversal start root node traverse left subtree first also need remember visit root node right subtree tree done let put stack remember traverse subtree pointed top stack follow rule inorder traversing left subtree left since node 5 doesnt subtrees print directly print parent 12 right child 6 putting everything stack helpful leftsubtree root node traversed print go right subtree going element get inorder traversal dont create stack recursion maintains correct order u sorry d algorithm binary tree d algorithm full binary tree d algorithm perfect binary tree d algorithm balanced binary tree Â© parewa lab pvt ltd right reserved
