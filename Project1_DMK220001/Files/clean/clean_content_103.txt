try programiz pro learn python practically get certified learn python practically get certified huffman coding technique compressing data reduce size without losing detail first developed david huffman huffman coding generally useful compress data frequently occurring character suppose string sent network character occupies 8 bit total 15 character string thus total 8 15 120 bit required send string using huffman coding technique compress string smaller size huffman coding first creates tree using frequency character generates code character data encoded decoded decoding done using tree huffman coding prevents ambiguity decoding process using concept prefix code ie code associated character present prefix code tree created help maintaining property huffman coding done help following step sending string network send tree well compressedcode total size given table without encoding total size string 120 bit encoding size reduced 32 15 28 75 decoding code take code traverse tree find character let 101 decoded traverse root figure time complexity encoding unique character based frequency onlog n extracting minimum frequency priority queue take place 2n1 time complexity olog n thus overall complexity onlog n sorry d algorithm full binary tree d algorithm perfect binary tree d algorithm tree traversal inorder preorder postorder d algorithm binary tree Â© parewa lab pvt ltd right reserved
