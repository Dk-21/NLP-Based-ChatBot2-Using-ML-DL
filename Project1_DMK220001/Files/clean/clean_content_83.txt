try programiz pro learn python practically get certified learn python practically get certified depth first search depth first traversal recursive algorithm searching vertex graph tree data structure traversal mean visiting node graph standard dfs implementation put vertex graph one two category purpose algorithm mark vertex visited avoiding cycle dfs algorithm work follows let see depth first search algorithm work example use undirected graph 5 vertex start vertex 0 dfs algorithm start putting visited list putting adjacent vertex stack next visit element top stack ie 1 go adjacent node since 0 already visited visit 2 instead vertex 2 unvisited adjacent vertex 4 add top stack visit visit last element 3 doesnt unvisited adjacent node completed depth first traversal graph pseudocode dfs shown init function notice run dfs function every node graph might two different disconnected part make sure cover every vertex also run dfs algorithm every node code depth first search algorithm example shown code simplified focus algorithm rather detail time complexity dfs algorithm represented form ov e v number node e number edge space complexity algorithm ov sorry d algorithm breadth first search d algorithm adjacency list d algorithm strongly connected component d algorithm graph data stucture Â© parewa lab pvt ltd right reserved
