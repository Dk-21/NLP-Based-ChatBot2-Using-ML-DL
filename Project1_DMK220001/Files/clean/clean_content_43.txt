try programiz pro learn python practically get certified learn python practically get certified article started learning algorithm wondered impactful boost careerprogramming skill also wonder big company like google facebook amazon hire programmer exceptionally good optimizing algorithm informally algorithm nothing mention step solve problem essentially solution example algorithm solve problem factorial might look something like problem find factorial n algorithm written english written programming language would call code instead code finding factorial number c programming data structure algorithm data structure used hold data algorithm used solve problem using data data structure algorithm dsa go solution standard problem detail give insight efficient use one also teach science evaluating efficiency algorithm enables choose best various choice time precious suppose alice bob trying solve simple problem finding sum first 1011 natural number bob writing algorithm alice implemented proving simple criticizing donald trump algorithm bob code alice alice bob feeling euphoric could build something almost time let sneak workspace listen conversation oops something went wrong computer deterministic machine going back trying run wont help let analyze whats wrong simple code two valuable resource computer program time memory time taken computer run code number instruction depends code used time taken execute code depends machine compiler case total number instruction executed let say x x 1 1011 1 1011 1 x 2 1011 3 let u assume computer execute 108 instruction one second vary subject machine configuration time taken run code possible optimize algorithm alice bob wait 33 minute every time run code sure already guessed right method sum first n natural number given formula converting code look something like code executes one instruction get task done matter value let greater total number atom universe find result time time taken solve problem case 1y 10 nanosecond way fusion reaction hydrogen bomb take 4050 n mean program complete successfully even someone throw hydrogen bomb computer time ran code note computer take instruction 1 compute multiplication division said 1 sake simplicity scalability scale plus ability mean quality algorithmsystem handle problem larger size consider problem setting classroom 50 student one simplest solution book room get blackboard chalk problem solved size problem increase number student increased 200 solution still hold need resource case probably need much larger room probably theater projector screen digital pen number student increased 1000 solution fails us lot resource size problem increase mean solution wasnt scalable scalable solution consider site like khanacademy million student see video read answer time resource required solution solve problem larger size resource crunch see first solution find sum first n natural number wasnt scalable required linear growth time linear growth size problem algorithm also known linearly scalable algorithm second solution scalable didnt require use time solve problem larger size known constanttime algorithm memory always available abundance dealing codesystem requires store produce lot data critical algorithm save usage memory wherever possible example storing data people save memory storing date birth age always calculate fly using date birth current date example learning algorithm data structure enable problem like finding people certain age group easily solved little modified version binary search algorithm assuming data sorted naive algorithm go person one one check fall given age group linearly scalable whereas binary search claim logarithmically scalable algorithm mean size problem squared time taken solve doubled suppose take 1 second find people certain age group 1000 group 1 million people binary search algorithm used find square root number imagine writing program find solution rubiks cube cute looking puzzle annoyingly 43252003274489856000 position position imagine number path one take reach wrong position fortunately way solve problem represented graph data structure graph algorithm known dijkstras algorithm allows solve problem linear time yes heard right mean allows reach solved position minimum number state dna molecule carry genetic information made smaller unit represented roman character c g imagine working field bioinformatics assigned work finding occurrence particular pattern dna strand famous problem computer science academia simplest algorithm take time proportional typical dna strand million unit eh worry kmp algorithm get done time proportional operator replaced make lot change considering pattern 100 character algorithm 100 time faster pattern 1000 character kmp algorithm would almost 1000 time faster able find occurrence pattern 1 second take 1 m also put another way instead matching 1 strand match 1000 strand similar length time infinite story generally software development involves learning new technology daily basis get learn technology using one project however case algorithm dont know algorithm well wont able identify optimize code writing right expected know advance apply wherever possible critical specifically talked scalability algorithm software system consists many algorithm optimizing one lead better system however important note way make system scalable example technique known distributed computing allows independent part program run multiple machine together making even scalable sorry d algorithm greedy
