try programiz pro learn python practically get certified learn python practically get certified prims algorithm minimum spanning tree algorithm take graph input find subset edge graph fall class algorithm called greedy algorithm find local optimum hope finding global optimum start one vertex keep adding edge lowest weight reach goal step implementing prims algorithm follows pseudocode prims algorithm show create two set vertex u vu u contains list vertex visited vu list vertex havent one one move vertex set vu set u connecting least weight edge although adjacency matrix representation graph used algorithm also implemented using adjacency list improve efficiency kruskals algorithm another popular minimum spanning tree algorithm us different logic find mst graph instead starting vertex kruskals algorithm sort edge low weight high keep adding lowest edge ignoring edge create cycle time complexity prims algorithm oe log v sorry d algorithm spanning tree minimum spanning tree d algorithm kruskals algorithm d algorithm graph data stucture d algorithm bellman ford algorithm Â© parewa lab pvt ltd right reserved
