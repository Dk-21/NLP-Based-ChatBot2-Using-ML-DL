try programiz pro learn python practically get certified learn python practically get certified literal meaning polymorphism condition occurrence different form polymorphism important concept programming refers use single type entity method operator object represent different type different scenario let take example know operator used extensively python program single usage integer data type operator used perform arithmetic addition operation hence program output 3 similarly string data type operator used perform concatenation result program output python programming see single operator used carry different operation distinct data type one simple occurrence polymorphism python function python compatible run multiple data type one function len function run many data type python let look example use case function output see many data type string list tuple set dictionary work len function however see return specific information specific data type polymorphism important concept objectoriented programming learn oop python visit python objectoriented programming use concept polymorphism creating class method python allows different class method name later generalize calling method disregarding object working let look example output created two class cat dog share similar structure method name info makesound however notice created common superclass linked class together way even pack two different object tuple iterate using common animal variable possible due polymorphism like programming language child class python also inherit method attribute parent class redefine certain method attribute specifically fit child class known method overriding polymorphism allows u access overridden method attribute name parent class let look example output see method str overridden child class used parent class due polymorphism python interpreter automatically recognizes fact method object asquare class overridden us one defined child class hand since fact method object b isnt overridden used parent shape class note method overloading way create multiple method name different argument possible python also read sorry python tutorial python object oriented programming python tutorial python multiple inheritance python tutorial python inheritance python tutorial python class object Â© parewa lab pvt ltd right reserved
