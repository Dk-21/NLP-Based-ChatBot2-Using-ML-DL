try programiz pro learn python practically get certified learn python practically get certified adjacency matrix way representing graph matrix booleans 0 1 finite graph represented form square matrix computer boolean value matrix indicates direct path two vertex example graph represent graph matrix form like cell tablematrix represented aij j vertex value aij either 1 0 depending whether edge vertex vertex j path j value aij 1 otherwise 0 instance path vertex 1 vertex 2 a12 1 path vertex 1 3 a13 0 case undirected graph matrix symmetric diagonal every edge ij also edge ji know create twodimensional array also know create adjacency matrix sorry d algorithm adjacency list d algorithm graph data stucture d algorithm depth first search dfs d algorithm breadth first search Â© parewa lab pvt ltd right reserved
