try programiz pro learn python practically get certified learn python practically get certified greedy algorithm approach solving problem selecting best option available moment doesnt worry whether current best result bring overall optimal result algorithm never revers earlier decision even choice wrong work topdown approach algorithm may produce best result problem always go local best choice produce global best result however determine algorithm used problem problem following property 1 greedy choice property optimal solution problem found choosing best choice step without reconsidering previous step chosen problem solved using greedy approach property called greedy choice property 2 optimal substructure optimal overall solution problem corresponds optimal solution subproblems problem solved using greedy approach property called optimal substructure mentioned earlier greedy algorithm doesnt always produce optimal solution major disadvantage algorithm example suppose want find longest path graph root leaf let use greedy algorithm greedy approach 1 let start root node 20 weight right child 3 weight left child 2 2 problem find largest path optimal solution moment 3 greedy algorithm choose 3 3 finally weight child 3 1 give u final result 20 3 1 24 however optimal solution another path carry weight 20 2 10 32 shown image therefore greedy algorithm always give optimalfeasible solution let use algorithm solve problem solution sorry d algorithm dynamic programming d algorithm backtracking algorithm d algorithm prims algorithm d algorithm kruskals algorithm Â© parewa lab pvt ltd right reserved
