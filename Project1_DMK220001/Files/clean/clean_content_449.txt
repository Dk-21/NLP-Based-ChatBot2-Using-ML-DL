try programiz pro learn python practically get certified learn python practically get certified understand example knowledge following python programming topic highest common factor hcf greatest common divisor gcd two number largest positive integer perfectly divide two given number example hcf 12 14 2 output two integer stored variable num1 num2 passed computehcf function function computes hcf two number return function first determine smaller two number since hcf le equal smallest number use loop go 1 number iteration check number perfectly divide input number store number hcf completion loop end largest number perfectly divide number method easy understand implement efficient much efficient method find hcf euclidean algorithm algorithm based fact hcf two number divide difference well algorithm divide greater smaller take remainder divide smaller remainder repeat remainder 0 example want find hcf 54 24 divide 54 24 remainder 6 divide 24 6 remainder 0 hence 6 required hcf loop becomes zero statement x x swapping value python click learn swapping variable python iteration place value x remainder x simultaneously becomes zero hcf x also read sorry python example find lcm python example find largest among three number python example find number divisible another number python example find sum natural number Â© parewa lab pvt ltd right reserved
