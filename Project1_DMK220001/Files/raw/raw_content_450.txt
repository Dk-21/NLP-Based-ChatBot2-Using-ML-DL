To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Python programming topics: Output Note: Run the program again to shuffle the cards.
In the program, we used the product() function in itertools module to create a deck of
    cards.
This function performs the Cartesian product of the two sequences.
The two sequences are numbers from 1 to 13 and the four suits.
So, altogether we have 13 * 4 = 52 items in the deck
    with each card as a tuple.
For example, Our deck is ordered, so we shuffle it using the function shuffle() in random module.
Finally, we draw the first five cards and display it to the user.
We will get different output each time you run this
    program as shown in our two outputs.
Here we have used the standard modules itertools and random that comes with Python.
