To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Python programming topics: Let's understand the difference between type() and isinstance() with the example code below.
Output In the above example, we see that type() cannot distinguish whether an instance of a class is somehow related to the base class.
In our case, although obj_triangle is an instance of child class Triangle, it is inherited from the base class Polygon.
If you want to relate the object of a child class with the base class, you can achieve this with isinstance().
Sorry about that.
