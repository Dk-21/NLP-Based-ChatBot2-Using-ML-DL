To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Python programming topics: A palindrome is a string that is the same read forward or backward.
For example, "dad" is the same in forward or reverse direction.
Another example is "aibohphobia", which literally means, an irritable fear of palindromes.
Output Note: To test the program, change the value of my_str in the program.
In this program, we have taken a string stored in my_str.
Using the method casefold() we make it suitable for caseless comparisons.
Basically, this method returns a lowercased version of the string.
We reverse the string using the built-in function reversed().
Since this function returns a reversed object, we use the list() function to convert them into a list before comparing.
Sorry about that.
