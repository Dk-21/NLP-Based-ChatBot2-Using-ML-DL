Prim's algorithm is a minimum spanning tree algorithm that takes a graph as input and finds the subset of the edges of that graph which It falls under a class of algorithms called greedy algorithms that find the local optimum in the hopes of finding a global optimum.
We start from one vertex and keep adding edges with the lowest weight until we reach our goal.
The steps for implementing Prim's algorithm are as follows: The pseudocode for prim's algorithm shows how we create two sets of vertices U and V-U.
U contains the list of vertices that have been visited and V-U the list of vertices that haven't.
One by one, we move vertices from set V-U to set U by connecting the least weight edge.
Although adjacency matrix representation of graphs is used, this algorithm can also be implemented using Adjacency List to improve its efficiency.
Kruskal's algorithm is another popular minimum spanning tree algorithm that uses a different logic to find the MST of a graph.
Instead of starting from a vertex, Kruskal's algorithm sorts all the edges from low weight to high and keeps adding the lowest edges, ignoring those edges that create a cycle.
The time complexity of Prim's algorithm is O(E log V).
Sorry about that.
