A fibonacci heap is a tree based data structure which consists of a collection of trees with min heap or max heap property.
Its operations are more efficient in terms of time complexity than those of its similar data structures like binomial heap and binary heap.
Now, we will discuss two of its important operations.
In decreasing a key operation, the value of a key is decreased to a lower value.
Following functions are used for decreasing the key.
The above operations can be understood in the examples below.
This process makes use of decrease-key and extract-min operations.
The following steps are followed for deleting a node.
Sorry about that.
