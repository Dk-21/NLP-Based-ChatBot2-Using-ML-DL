A class can be derived from more than one superclass in Python.
This is called multiple inheritance.
For example, a class Bat is derived from superclasses Mammal and WingedAnimal.
It makes sense because bat is a mammal as well as a winged animal.
Here, the MultiDerived class is derived from SuperClass1 and SuperClass2 classes.
Output In the above example, the Bat class is derived from two super classes: Mammal and WingedAnimal.
Notice the statements, Here, we are using b1 (object of Bat) to access mammal_info() and winged_animal_info() methods of the Mammal and the WingedAnimal class respectively.
In Python, not only can we derive a class from the superclass but you can also derive a class from the derived class.
This form of inheritance is known as multilevel inheritance.
Here's the syntax of the multilevel inheritance, Here, the DerivedClass1 class is derived from the SuperClass class, and the DerivedClass2 class is derived from the DerivedClass1 class.
Output In the above example, DerivedClass2 is derived from DerivedClass1, which is derived from SuperClass.
It means that DerivedClass2 inherits all the attributes and methods of both DerivedClass1 and SuperClass.
Hence, we are using d2 (object of DerivedClass2) to call methods from SuperClass, DerivedClass1, and DerivedClass2.
If two superclasses have the same method (function) name and the derived class calls that method, Python uses the MRO to search for the right method to call.
For example, Here, SuperClass1 and SuperClass2 both of these classes define a method info().
So when info() is called using the d1 object of the Derived class, Python uses the MRO to determine which method to call.
In this case, the MRO specifies that methods should be inherited from the leftmost superclass first, so info() of SuperClass1 is called rather than that of SuperClass2.
