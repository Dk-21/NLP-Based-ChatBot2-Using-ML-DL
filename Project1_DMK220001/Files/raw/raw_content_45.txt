The master method is a formula for solving recurrence relations of the form: An asymptotically positive function means that for a sufficiently large value of n, we have f(n) > 0.
The master theorem is used in calculating the time complexity of recurrence relations (divide and conquer algorithms) in a simple and quick way.
If a ≥ 1 and b > 1 are constants and f(n) is an asymptotically positive function, then the time complexity of a recursive relation is given by  Each of the above conditions can be interpreted as: The master theorem cannot be used if: Sorry about that.
