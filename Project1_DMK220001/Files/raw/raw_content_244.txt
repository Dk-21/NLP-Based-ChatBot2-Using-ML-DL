A tuple is a collection of data similar to a Python list.
The only difference is that we cannot modify a tuple once it has been created.
We create a tuple by placing items inside parentheses ().
For example, We can also create a tuple using a tuple() constructor.
For example, Here are the different types of tuples we can create in Python.
Empty Tuple Tuple of different data types Tuple of mixed data types Tuples are: Each item in a tuple is associated with a number, known as a index.
The index always starts from 0, meaning the first item of a tuple is at index 0, the second item is at index 1, and so on.
We use index numbers to access tuple items.
For example, Python tuples are immutable (unchangeable).
We cannot add, change, or delete items of a tuple.
If we try to modify a tuple, we will get an error.
For example, We use the len() function to find the number of items present in a tuple.
For example, We use the for loop to iterate over the items of a tuple.
For example, Output We use the in keyword to check if an item exists in the tuple.
For example, Here, Python Tuples are immutable - we cannot change the items of a tuple once created.
If we try to do so, we will get an error.
For example, We cannot delete individual items of a tuple.
However, we can delete the tuple itself using the del statement.
For example, Here, we have deleted the animals tuple.
When we want to create a tuple with a single item, we might do the following: But this would not create a tuple; instead, it would be considered a string.
To solve this, we need to include a trailing comma after the item.
For example, Also Read: Sorry about that.
