In programming, the break and continue statements are used to alter the flow of loops: The break statement terminates the loop immediately when it's encountered.
Syntax The above image shows the working of break statements in for and while loops.
Note: The break statement is usually used inside decision-making statements such as if...else.
We can use the break statement with the for loop to terminate the loop when a certain condition is met.
For example, Output In the above example,  terminates the loop when i is equal to 3.
Hence, the output doesn't include values after 2.
Note: We can also terminate the while loop using a break statement.
We can also terminate the while loop using the break statement.
For example,  Output In the above example, terminates the loop when i is equal to 3.
The continue statement skips the current iteration of the loop and the control flow of the program goes to the next iteration.
Syntax We can use the continue statement with the for loop to skip the current iteration of the loop and jump to the next iteration.
For example, Output In the above example,  skips the current iteration when i is equal to 3, and continues the next iteration.
Hence, the output has all the values except 3.
Note: We can also use the  continue statement with a while loop.
We can skip the current iteration of the while loop using the continue statement.
For example, Output In the above example, we have used the while loop to print the odd numbers between 1 and 10.
Here, skips the current iteration when the number is even and starts the next iteration.
