In Python, we use the while loop to repeat a block of code until a certain condition is met.
For example, Output In the above example, we have used a while loop to print the numbers from 1 to 3.
The loop runs as long as the condition number <= 3 is satisfied.
Here, Output  Here is how the above program works: If the condition of a while loop is always True, the loop runs for infinite times, forming an infinite while loop.
For example, Output The above program is equivalent to: We can use a break statement inside a while loop to terminate the loop immediately without checking the test condition.
For example, Output Here, the condition of the while loop is always True.
However, if the user enters end, the loop termiantes because of the break statement.
Output Here, on the third iteration, the  counter becomes 2 which terminates the loop.
It then executes the else block and prints This is inside else block.
Note: The else block will not execute if the while loop is terminated by a break statement.
The for loop is usually used in the sequence when the number of iterations is known.
For example, Output The while loop is usually used when the number of iterations is unknown.
For example, Output Also Read: Sorry about that.
