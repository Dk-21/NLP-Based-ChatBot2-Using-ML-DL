To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Python programming topics: When we want to send the same invitations to many people, the body of the mail does not change.
Only the name (and maybe address) needs to be changed.
Mail merge is a process of doing this.
Instead of writing each mail separately, we have a template for body of the mail and a list of names that we merge together to form all the mails.
For this program, we have written all the names in separate lines in the file "names.txt".
The body is in the "body.txt" file.
We open both the files in reading mode and iterate over each name using a for loop.
A new file with the name "[name].txt" is created, where name is the name of that person.
We use the strip() method to clean up leading and trailing whitespaces (reading a line from the file also reads the newline '\n' character).
Finally, we write the content of the mail into this file using the write() method.
