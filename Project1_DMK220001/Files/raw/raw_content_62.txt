A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each parent node can have at most two children.
Each node of a binary tree consists of three items: data item address of left child address of right child A full Binary tree is a special type of binary tree in which every parent node/internal node has either two or no children.
To learn more, please visit full binary tree.
A perfect binary tree is a type of binary tree in which every internal node has exactly two child nodes and all the leaf nodes are at the same level.
To learn more, please visit perfect binary tree.
A complete binary tree is just like a full binary tree, but with two major differences To learn more, please visit complete binary tree.
A degenerate or pathological tree is the tree having a single child either left or right.
A skewed binary tree is a pathological/degenerate tree in which the tree is either dominated by the left nodes or the right nodes.
Thus, there are two types of skewed binary tree: left-skewed binary tree and right-skewed binary tree.
It is a type of binary tree in which the difference between the height of the left and the right subtree for each node is either 0 or 1.
To learn more, please visit balanced binary tree.
A node of a binary tree is represented by a structure containing a data part and two pointers to other structures of the same type.
Sorry about that.
