Inserting an element into a B+ tree consists of three main events: searching the appropriate leaf, inserting the element and balancing/splitting the tree.
Let us understand these events below.
Before inserting an element into a B+ tree, these properties must be kept in mind.
The following steps are followed for inserting an element.
Let us understand the insertion operation with the illustrations below.
The elements to be inserted are 5,15, 25, 35, 45.
Time complexity: Θ(t.logt n) The complexity is dominated by Θ(logt n).
Sorry about that.
