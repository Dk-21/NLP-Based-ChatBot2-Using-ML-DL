There are various linked list operations that allow us to perform different actions on linked lists.
For example, the insertion operation adds a new element to the linked list.
Here's a list of basic linked list operations that we will cover in this article.
Before you learn about linked list operations in detail, make sure to know about Linked List first.
In all of the examples, we will assume that the linked list has three nodes 1 --->2 --->3 with node structure as below: Displaying the contents of a linked list is very simple.
We keep moving the temp node to the next one and display its contents.
When temp is NULL, we know that we have reached the end of the linked list so we get out of the while loop.
The output of this program will be:  You can add elements to either the beginning, middle or end of the linked list.
You can delete either from the beginning, end or from a particular position.
You can search an element on a linked list using a loop using the following steps.
We are finding item on a linked list.
We will use a simple sorting algorithm, Bubble Sort, to sort the elements of a linked list in ascending order below.
Check the article on bubble sort for better understanding of its working.
Sorry about that.
