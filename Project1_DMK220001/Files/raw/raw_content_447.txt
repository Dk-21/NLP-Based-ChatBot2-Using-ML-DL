To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Python programming topics: The decimal system is the most widely used number system.
However, computers only understand binary.
Binary, octal and hexadecimal number systems are closely related, and we may require to convert decimal into these systems.
The decimal system is base 10 (ten symbols, 0-9, are used to represent a number) and similarly, binary is base 2, octal is base 8 and hexadecimal is base 16.
A number with the prefix 0b is considered binary, 0o is considered octal and 0x as hexadecimal.
For example: Output Note: To test the program for other decimal numbers, change the value of dec in the program.
In this program, we have used built-in functions bin(), oct() and hex() to convert the given decimal number into respective number systems.
These functions take an integer (in decimal) and return a string.
