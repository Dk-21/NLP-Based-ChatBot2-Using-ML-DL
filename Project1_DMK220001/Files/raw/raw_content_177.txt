So, how do I start?
C++ is a powerful object-oriented programming language with the memory-management capabilities of C. Thanks to these incredible features, C++ is used to build high-performance and enterprise-level software.
Large companies such as Apple, Microsoft, and Google use C++ to create applications that serve billions of users.
Some of these applications include operating systems, video games, web browsers, word processors, firmware for computers and electronic devices, and many more.
Therefore, learning C++ can open up multiple avenues for a lucrative career in the tech industry.
Compared to other programming languages, C++ might appear more challenging due to its complex syntax and strict typing system.
However, you will become comfortable with C++ with consistent practice and dedication.
But if you are particularly interested in testing, Python might be a suitable option to explore as it is relatively easy to learn and widely used for test automation.
Programmers favor C++ when building high-performance software as well as large enterprise-level applications.
Here are a few areas where C++ Programming is used: The duration depends on your learning pace and dedication.
On average, it takes 3-6 months to learn C++.
