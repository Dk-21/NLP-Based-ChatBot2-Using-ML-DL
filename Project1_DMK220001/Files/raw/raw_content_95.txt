Shell sort is a generalized version of the insertion sort algorithm.
It first sorts elements that are far apart from each other and successively reduces the interval between the elements to be sorted.
The interval between the elements is reduced based on the sequence used.
Some of the optimal sequences that can be used in the shell sort algorithm are: Note: The performance of the shell sort depends on the type of sequence used for a given input array.
Shell sort is an unstable sorting algorithm because this algorithm does not examine the elements lying in between the intervals.
The complexity depends on the interval chosen.
The above complexities differ for different increment sequences chosen.
Best increment sequence is unknown.
The space complexity for shell sort is O(1).
Shell sort is used when: Sorry about that.
