In programming, type conversion is the process of converting data of one type to another.
For example: converting int data to str.
There are two types of type conversion in Python.
In certain situations, Python automatically converts one data type to another.
This is known as implicit type conversion.
Let's see an example where Python promotes the conversion of the lower data type (integer) to the higher data type (float) to avoid data loss.
Output In the above example, we have created two variables: integer_number and float_number of int and float type respectively.
Then we added these two variables and stored the result in new_number.
As we can see new_number has value 124.23 and is of the float data type.
It is because Python always converts smaller data types to larger data types to avoid the loss of data.
Note: In Explicit Type Conversion, users convert the data type of an object to required data type.
We use the built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), etc to perform explicit type conversion.
This type of conversion is also called typecasting because the user casts (changes) the data type of the objects.
Output In the above example, we have created two variables: num_string and num_integer with str and int type values respectively.
Notice the code, Here, we have used int() to perform explicit type conversion of num_string to integer type.
After converting num_string to an integer value, Python is able to add these two variables.
Finally, we got the num_sum value i.e 35 and data type to be int.
