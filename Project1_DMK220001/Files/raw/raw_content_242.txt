In Python programming, the pass statement is a null statement which can be used as a placeholder for future code.
Suppose we have a loop or a function that is not implemented yet, but we want to implement it in the future.
In such cases, we can use the pass statement.
The syntax of the pass statement is: Here, notice that we have used the pass statement inside the if statement .
However, nothing happens when the pass is executed.
It results in no operation (NOP).
Suppose we didn't use pass or just put a comment as: Here, we will get an error message: IndentationError: expected an indented block Note: The difference between a comment and a pass statement in Python is that while the interpreter ignores a comment entirely, pass is not ignored.
We can do the same thing in an empty function or class as well.
For example, Also Read: Sorry about that.
