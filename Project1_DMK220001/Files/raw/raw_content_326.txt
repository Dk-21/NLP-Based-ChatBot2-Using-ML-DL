To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Python programming topics: The format for list slicing is [start:stop:step].
List slicing works similar to Python slice() function.
Output If you simply use :, you will get all the elements of the list.
This is similar to print(my_list).
Output If you want to get all the elements after a specific index, you can mention that index before : as shown in example above.
In the above example, elements at index 2 and all the elements after index 2 are printed.
Note: Indexing starts from 0.
Item on index 2 is also included.
Output This example lets you get all the elements before a specific index.
Mention that index after :.
In the example, the items before index 2 are sliced.
Item on index 2 is excluded.
Output If you want to get all the elements between two specific indices, you can mention them before and after :.
In the above example, my_list[2:4] gives the elements between 2nd and the 4th positions.
The starting position (i.e.
2) is included and the ending position (i.e.
4) is excluded.
Output If you want to get elements at specified intervals, you can do it by using two :.
In the above example, the items at interval 2 starting from index 0 are sliced.
If you want the indexing to start from the last item, you can use negative sign -.
Output The items at interval 2 starting from the last index are sliced.
If you want the items from one position to another, you can mention them from start to stop.
Output The items from index 1 to 4 are sliced with intervals of 2.
