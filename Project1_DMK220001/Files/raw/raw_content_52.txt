Deque or Double Ended Queue is a type of queue in which insertion and removal of elements can either be performed from the front or the rear.
Thus, it does not follow FIFO rule (First In First Out).
Below is the circular array implementation of deque.
In a circular array, if the array is full, we start from the beginning.
But in a linear array implementation, if the array is full, no more elements can be inserted.
In each of the operations below, if the array is full, "overflow message" is thrown.
Before performing the following operations, these steps are followed.
This operation adds an element at the front.
This operation adds an element to the rear.
The operation deletes an element from the front.
This operation deletes an element from the rear.
This operation checks if the deque is empty.
If front = -1, the deque is empty.
This operation checks if the deque is full.
If front = 0 and rear = n - 1 OR front = rear + 1, the deque is full.
The time complexity of all the above operations is constant i.e.
O(1).
Sorry about that.
