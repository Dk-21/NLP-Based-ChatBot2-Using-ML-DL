To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Python programming topics: JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group.
It is one of the most widely used compression techniques for image compression.
Most of the file formats have headers (initial few bytes) which contain useful information about the file.
For example, jpeg headers contain information like height, width, number of color (grayscale or RGB) etc.
In this program, we find the resolution of a jpeg image reading these headers, without using any external library.
Output In this program, we opened the image in binary mode.
Non-text files must be open in this mode.
The height of the image is at 164th position followed by width of the image.
Both are 2 bytes long.
Note that this is true only for JPEG File Interchange Format (JFIF) standard.
If your image is encode using other standard (like EXIF), the code will not work.
We convert the 2 bytes into a number using bitwise shifting operator <<.
Finally, the resolution is displayed.
