A strongly connected component is the portion of a directed graph in which there is a path from each vertex to another vertex.
It is applicable only on a directed graph.
For example: Let us take the graph below.
The strongly connected components of the above graph are: You can observe that in the first strongly connected component, every vertex can reach the other vertex through the directed path.
These components can be found using Kosaraju's Algorithm.
Kosaraju's Algorithm is based on the depth-first search algorithm implemented twice.
Three steps are involved.
Kosaraju's algorithm runs in linear time i.e.
O(V+E).
Sorry about that.
