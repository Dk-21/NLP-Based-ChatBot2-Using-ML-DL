Before you learn about the type of the linked list, make sure you know about the LinkedList Data Structure.
There are three common types of Linked List.
It is the most common.
Each node has data and a pointer to the next node.
Node is represented as: A three-member singly linked list can be created as: We add a pointer to the previous node in a doubly-linked list.
Thus, we can go in either direction: forward or backward.
A node is represented as  A three-member doubly linked list can be created as If you want to learn more about it, please visit doubly linked list and operations on it.
A circular linked list is a variation of a linked list in which the last element is linked to the first element.
This forms a circular loop.
A circular linked list can be either singly linked or doubly linked.
A three-member circular singly linked list can be created as: If you want to learn more about it, please visit circular linked list and operations on it.
Sorry about that.
