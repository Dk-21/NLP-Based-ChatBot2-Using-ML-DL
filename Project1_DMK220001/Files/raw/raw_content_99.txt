Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is a greedy approach for calculating the maximum possible flow in a network or a graph.
A term, flow network, is used to describe a network of vertices and edges with a source (S) and a sink (T).
Each vertex, except S and T, can receive and send an equal amount of stuff through it.
S can only send and T can only receive stuff.
We can visualize the understanding of the algorithm using a flow of liquid inside a network of pipes of different capacities.
Each pipe has a certain capacity of liquid it can transfer at an instance.
For this algorithm, we are going to find how much liquid can be flowed from the source to the sink at an instance using the network.
It is the path available in a flow network.
It represents the flow network that has additional possible flow.
It is the capacity of the edge after subtracting the flow from the maximum capacity.
The algorithm follows: We can also consider reverse-path if required because if we do not consider them, we may never find a maximum flow.
The above concepts can be understood with the example below.
The flow of all the edges is 0 at the beginning.
Note that if the capacity for any edge is full, then that path cannot be used.
Sorry about that.
