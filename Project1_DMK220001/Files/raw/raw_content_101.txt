Kruskal's algorithm is a minimum spanning tree algorithm that takes a graph as input and finds the subset of the edges of that graph which It falls under a class of algorithms called greedy algorithms that find the local optimum in the hopes of finding a global optimum.
We start from the edges with the lowest weight and keep adding edges until we reach our goal.
The steps for implementing Kruskal's algorithm are as follows: Any minimum spanning tree algorithm revolves around checking if adding an edge creates a loop or not.
The most common way to find this out is an algorithm called Union FInd.
The Union-Find algorithm divides the vertices into clusters and allows us to check if two vertices belong to the same cluster or not and hence decide whether adding an edge creates a cycle.
Prim's algorithm is another popular minimum spanning tree algorithm that uses a different logic to find the MST of a graph.
Instead of starting from an edge, Prim's algorithm starts from a vertex and keeps adding lowest-weight edges which aren't in the tree, until all vertices have been covered.
The time complexity Of Kruskal's Algorithm is: O(E log E).
Sorry about that.
