A stack is a linear data structure that follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO).
This means the last element inserted inside the stack is removed first.
You can think of the stack data structure as the pile of plates on top of another.
Here, you can: And, if you want the plate at the bottom, you must first remove all the plates on top.
This is exactly how the stack data structure works.
In programming terms, putting an item on top of the stack is called push and removing an item is called pop.
In the above image, although item 3 was kept last, it was removed first.
This is exactly how the LIFO (Last In First Out) Principle works.
We can implement a stack in any programming language like C, C++, Java, Python or C#, but the specification is pretty much the same.
There are some basic operations that allow us to perform different actions on a stack.
The operations work as follows: The most common stack implementation is using arrays, but it can also be implemented using lists.
For the array-based implementation of a stack, the push and pop operations take constant time, i.e.
O(1).
Although stack is a simple data structure to implement, it is very powerful.
The most common uses of a stack are: Sorry about that.
