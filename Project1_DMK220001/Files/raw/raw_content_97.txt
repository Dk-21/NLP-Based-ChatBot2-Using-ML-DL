Binary Search is a searching algorithm for finding an element's position in a sorted array.
In this approach, the element is always searched in the middle of a portion of an array.
Binary search can be implemented only on a sorted list of items.
If the elements are not sorted already, we need to sort them first.
Binary Search Algorithm can be implemented in two ways which are discussed below.
The recursive method follows the divide and conquer approach.
The general steps for both methods are discussed below.
Time Complexities Space Complexity The space complexity of the binary search is O(1).
Sorry about that.
