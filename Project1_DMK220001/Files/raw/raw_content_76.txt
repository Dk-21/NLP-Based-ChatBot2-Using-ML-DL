Red-Black tree is a self-balancing binary search tree in which each node contains an extra bit for denoting the color of the node, either red or black.
Before reading this article, please refer to the article on red-black tree.
While inserting a new node, the new node is always inserted as a RED node.
After insertion of a new node, if the tree is violating the properties of the red-black tree then, we do the following operations.
Following steps are followed for inserting a new element into a red-black tree: Why newly inserted nodes are always red in a red-black tree?
This is because inserting a red node does not violate the depth property of a red-black tree.
If you attach a red node to a red node, then the rule is violated but it is easier to fix this problem than the problem introduced by violating the depth property.
This algorithm is used for maintaining the property of a red-black tree if insertion of a newNode violates this property.
The final tree look like this: Sorry about that.
