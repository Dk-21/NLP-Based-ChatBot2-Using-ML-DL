To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Python programming topics: Output In this program, we use the temp variable to hold the value of x temporarily.
We then put the value of y in x and later temp in y.
In this way, the values get exchanged.
In Python, there is a simple construct to swap variables.
The following code does the same as above but without the use of any temporary variable.
If the variables are both numbers, we can use arithmetic operations to do the same.
It might not look intuitive at first sight.
But if you think about it, it is pretty easy to figure it out.
Here are a few examples Addition and Subtraction Multiplication and Division XOR swap This algorithm works for integers only Also Read:  Sorry about that.
