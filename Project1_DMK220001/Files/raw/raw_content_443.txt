To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Python programming topics: A positive integer is called an Armstrong number of order n if In case of an Armstrong number of 3 digits, the sum of cubes of each digit is equal to the number itself.
For example: Output 1 Output 2 Here, we ask the user for a number and check if it is an Armstrong number.
We need to calculate the sum of the cube of each digit.
So, we initialize the sum to 0 and obtain each digit number by using the modulus operator %.
The remainder of a number when it is divided by 10 is the last digit of that number.
We take the cubes using exponent operator.
Finally, we compare the sum with the original number and conclude that it is Armstrong number if they are equal.
You can change the value of num in the source code and run again to test it.
