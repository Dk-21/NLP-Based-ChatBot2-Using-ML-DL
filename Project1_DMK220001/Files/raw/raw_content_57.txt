Heap data structure is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property, where any given node is This type of data structure is also called a binary heap.
Some of the important operations performed on a heap are described below along with their algorithms.
Heapify is the process of creating a heap data structure from a binary tree.
It is used to create a Min-Heap or a Max-Heap.
Algorithm To create a Max-Heap: For Min-Heap, both leftChild and rightChild must be larger than the parent for all nodes.
Algorithm for insertion in Max Heap  For Min Heap, the above algorithm is modified so that parentNode is always smaller than newNode.
Algorithm for deletion in Max Heap For Min Heap, above algorithm is modified so that both childNodes are greater smaller than currentNode.
Peek operation returns the maximum element from Max Heap or minimum element from Min Heap without deleting the node.
For both Max heap and Min Heap Extract-Max returns the node with maximum value after removing it from a Max Heap whereas Extract-Min returns the node with minimum after removing it from Min Heap.
Sorry about that.
