To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Python programming topics: In Python, we can implement a matrix as nested list (list inside a list).
We can treat each element as a row of the matrix.
For example X = [[1, 2], [4, 5], [3, 6]] would represent a 3x2 matrix.
The first row can be selected as X[0].
And, the element in first row, first column can be selected as X[0][0].
Multiplication of two matrices X and Y is defined only if the number of columns in X is equal to the number of rows Y.
If X is a n x m matrix and Y is a m x l matrix then, XY is defined and has the dimension n x l (but YX is not defined).
Here are a couple of ways to implement matrix multiplication in Python.
Output In this program, we have used nested for loops to iterate through each row and each column.
We accumulate the sum of products in the result.
This technique is simple but computationally expensive as we increase the order of the matrix.
For larger matrix operations we recommend optimized software packages like NumPy which is several (in the order of 1000) times faster than the above code.
The output of this program is the same as above.
To understand the above code we must first know about built-in function zip() and unpacking argument list using * operator.
We have used nested list comprehension to iterate through each element in the matrix.
The code looks complicated and unreadable at first.
But once you get the hang of list comprehensions, you will probably not go back to nested loops.
