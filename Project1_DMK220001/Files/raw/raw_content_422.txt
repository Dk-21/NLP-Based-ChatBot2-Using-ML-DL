Python offers random module that can generate random numbers.
These are pseudo-random number as the sequence of number generated depends on the seed.
If the seeding value is same, the sequence will be the same.
For example, if you use 2 as the seeding value, you will always see the following sequence.
The output will always follow the sequence:  Not so random eh?
Since this generator is completely deterministic, it must not be used for encryption purpose.
Here is the list of all the functions defined in random module with a brief explanation of what they do.
