To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Python programming topics: ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange.
It is a numeric value given to different characters and symbols, for computers to store and manipulate.
For example, the ASCII value of the letter 'A' is 65.
Output Note: To test this program for other characters, change the character assigned to the c variable.
Here we have used ord() function to convert a character to an integer (ASCII value).
This function returns the Unicode code point of that character.
Unicode is also an encoding technique that provides a unique number to a character.
While ASCII only encodes 128 characters, the current Unicode has more than 100,000 characters from hundreds of scripts.
Your turn: Modify the code above to get characters from their corresponding ASCII values using the chr() function as shown below.
Here, ord() and chr() are built-in functions.
