The list pop() method removes the item at the specified index.
The method also returns the removed item.
The syntax of the pop() method is: The pop() method returns the item present at the given index.
This item is also removed from the list.
Output Note: Index in Python starts from 0, not 1.
If you need to pop the 4th element, you need to pass 3 to the pop() method.
Output If you need to remove the given item from the list, you can use the remove() method.
And, you can use the del statement to remove an item or slices from the list.
Sorry about that.
