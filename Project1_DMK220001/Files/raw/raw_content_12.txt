To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Python programming topics: The factorial of a number is the product of all the integers from 1 to that number.
For example, the factorial of 6 is 1*2*3*4*5*6 = 720.
Factorial is not defined for negative numbers, and the factorial of zero is one, 0!
= 1.
Output Note: To test the program for a different number, change the value of num.
Here, the number whose factorial is to be found is stored in num, and we check if the number is negative, zero or positive  using if...elif...else statement.
If the number is positive, we use for loop and  range() function to calculate the factorial.
In the above example, factorial() is a recursive function that calls itself.
Here, the function will recursively call itself by decreasing the value of the x.
