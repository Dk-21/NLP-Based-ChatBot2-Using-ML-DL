To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Python programming topics: A Fibonacci sequence is the integer sequence of 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8....
The first two terms are 0 and 1.
All other terms are obtained by adding the preceding two terms.
This means to say the nth term is the sum of (n-1)th and (n-2)th term.
Output Here, we store the number of terms in nterms.
We initialize the first term to 0 and the second term to 1.
If the number of terms is more than 2, we use a while loop to find the next term in the sequence by adding the preceding two terms.
We then interchange the variables (update it) and continue on with the process.
You can also print the Fibonacci sequence using recursion.
Sorry about that.
