Floyd-Warshall Algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest path between all the pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.
This algorithm works for both the directed and undirected weighted graphs.
But, it does not work for the graphs with negative cycles (where the sum of the edges in a cycle is negative).
A weighted graph is a graph in which each edge has a numerical value associated with it.
Floyd-Warhshall algorithm is also called as Floyd's algorithm, Roy-Floyd algorithm, Roy-Warshall algorithm, or WFI algorithm.
This algorithm follows the dynamic programming approach to find the shortest paths.
Let the given graph be:  Follow the steps below to find the shortest path between all the pairs of vertices.
There are three loops.
Each loop has constant complexities.
So, the time complexity of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm is O(n3).
The space complexity of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm is O(n2).
Sorry about that.
