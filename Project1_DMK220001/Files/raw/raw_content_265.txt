In Python, we can change the way operators work for user-defined types.
For example, the + operator will perform arithmetic addition on two numbers, merge two lists, or concatenate two strings.
This feature in Python that allows the same operator to have different meaning according to the context is called operator overloading.
Class functions that begin with double underscore __ are called special functions in Python.
The special functions are defined by the Python interpreter and used to implement certain features or behaviors.
They are called "double underscore" functions because they have a double underscore prefix and suffix, such as __init__() or __add__().
Here are some of the special functions available in Python, To overload the + operator, we will need to implement __add__() function in the class.
With great power comes great responsibility.
We can do whatever we like inside this function.
But it is more sensible to return the Point object of the coordinate sum.
Let's see an example, In the above example, what actually happens is that, when we use p1 + p2, Python calls p1.__add__(p2) which in turn is Point.__add__(p1,p2).
After this, the addition operation is carried out the way we specified.
Similarly, we can overload other operators as well.
The special function that we need to implement is tabulated below.
Python does not limit operator overloading to arithmetic operators only.
We can overload comparison operators as well.
Here's an example of how we can overload the < operator to compare two objects the Person class based on their age: Output Here, __lt__() overloads the < operator to compare the age attribute of two objects.
The __lt__() method returns, Similarly, the special functions that we need to implement, to overload other comparison operators are tabulated below.
Here are some advantages of operator overloading, Also Read: Sorry about that.
