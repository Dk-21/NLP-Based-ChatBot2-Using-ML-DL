An adjacency matrix is a way of representing a graph as a matrix of booleans (0's and 1's).
A finite graph can be represented in the form of a square matrix on a computer, where the boolean value of the matrix indicates if there is a direct path between two vertices.
For example, we have a graph below.
We can represent this graph in matrix form like below.
Each cell in the above table/matrix is represented as Aij, where i and j are vertices.
The value of Aij is either 1 or 0 depending on whether there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j.
If there is a path from i to j, then the value of Aij is 1 otherwise its 0.
For instance, there is a path from vertex 1 to vertex 2, so A12 is 1 and there is no path from vertex 1 to 3, so A13 is 0.
In case of undirected graphs, the matrix is symmetric about the diagonal because of every edge (i,j), there is also an edge (j,i).
If you know how to create two-dimensional arrays, you also know how to create an adjacency matrix.
Sorry about that.
