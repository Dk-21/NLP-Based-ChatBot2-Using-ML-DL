Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that selects the smallest element from an unsorted list in each iteration and places that element at the beginning of the unsorted list.
Number of comparisons: (n - 1) + (n - 2) + (n - 3) + ..... + 1 = n(n - 1) / 2 nearly equals to n2.
Complexity = O(n2) Also, we can analyze the complexity by simply observing the number of loops.
There are 2 loops so the complexity is n*n = n2.
Time Complexities:  The time complexity of the selection sort is the same in all cases.
At every step, you have to find the minimum element and put it in the right place.
The minimum element is not known until the end of the array is not reached.
Space Complexity: Space complexity is O(1) because an extra variable temp is used.
The selection sort is used when Sorry about that.
