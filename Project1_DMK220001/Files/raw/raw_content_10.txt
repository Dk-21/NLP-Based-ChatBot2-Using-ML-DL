To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Python programming topics: In the program below, we've used the + operator to add two numbers.
Output The program below calculates the sum of two numbers entered by the user.
Output In this program, we asked the user to enter two numbers and this program displays the sum of two numbers entered by user.
We use the built-in function input() to take the input.
Since, input() returns a string, we convert the string into number using the float() function.
Then, the numbers are added.
Alternative to this, we can perform this addition in a single statement without using any variables as follows.
Output Although this program uses no variable (memory efficient), it is harder to read.
Sorry about that.
