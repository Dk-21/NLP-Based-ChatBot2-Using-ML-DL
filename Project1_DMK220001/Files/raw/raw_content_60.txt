A tree is a nonlinear hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.
Other data structures such as arrays, linked list, stack, and queue are linear data structures that store data sequentially.
In order to perform any operation in a linear data structure, the time complexity increases with the increase in the data size.
But, it is not acceptable in today's computational world.
Different tree data structures allow quicker and easier access to the data as it is a non-linear data structure.
A node is an entity that contains a key or value and pointers to its child nodes.
The last nodes of each path are called leaf nodes or external nodes that do not contain a link/pointer to child nodes.
The node having at least a child node is called an internal node.
It is the link between any two nodes.
It is the topmost node of a tree.
The height of a node is the number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf (ie.
the longest path from the node to a leaf node).
The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node.
The height of a Tree is the height of the root node or the depth of the deepest node.
The degree of a node is the total number of branches of that node.
A collection of disjoint trees is called a forest.
You can create a forest by cutting the root of a tree.
In order to perform any operation on a tree, you need to reach to the specific node.
The tree traversal algorithm helps in visiting a required node in the tree.
