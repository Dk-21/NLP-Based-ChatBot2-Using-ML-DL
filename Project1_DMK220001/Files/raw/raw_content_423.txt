To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Python programming topics: A Fibonacci sequence is the integer sequence of 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8....
The first two terms are 0 and 1.
All other terms are obtained by adding the preceding two terms.This means to say the nth term is the sum of (n-1)th and (n-2)th term.
Output Note: To test the program, change the value of nterms.
In this program, we store the number of terms to be displayed in nterms.
A recursive function recur_fibo() is used to calculate the nth term of the sequence.
We use a for loop to iterate and calculate each term recursively.
