To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following Python programming topics: Output In this program, we store the number in num and find the square root using the ** exponent operator.
This program works for all positive real numbers.
But for negative or complex numbers, it can be done as follows.
Output In this program, we use the sqrt() function in the cmath (complex math) module.
Note: If we want to take complex number as input directly, like 3+4j, we have to use the eval() function instead of float().
The eval() method can be used to convert complex numbers as input to the complex objects in Python.
